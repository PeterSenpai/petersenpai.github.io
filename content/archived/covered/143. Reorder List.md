# LC143. Reorder List

https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

This problem can be solved in the following steps.

1/ Find the middle node ([LC876](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/)), but also keep track of the node before mid node so that we can break the list into two.

2/ Reverse the second list

3/ Merge 2 lists

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        slow = fast = head
        before_slow = None

        while fast and fast.next:
            before_slow = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        before_slow.next = None
        curr = slow
        prev = None

        while curr:
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp

        curr2 = prev
        curr1 = head
        while curr2:
            tmp = curr1.next
            curr1.next = curr2
            curr1 = curr2
            curr2 = tmp
```
