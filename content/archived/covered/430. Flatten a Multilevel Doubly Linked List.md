# LC430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/

```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        # create a recursive function that flatterns the list
        # the helper flatterns the list by getting the flattern child list's tail and joint to the next node
        # The base cases are the key, we should check if a node
        # 1/ is None
        # 2/ is last node (no child, no next)
        # if it's not the last node and has no child, we should call helper(head.next), note that we won't change the connection here since we only do something when there's child
        # if it has a child, we should call the helper(head.child), and get the last node of the flattern child, then we do some connections
        # after the connection, we should continue helper(next.node)
        def helper(head):
            if not head:
                return None
            if not head.child and not head.next:
                return head
            if not head.child:
                return helper(head.next)

            child_list_tail = helper(head.child)

            next_node = head.next
            if next_node:
                child_list_tail.next = next_node
                next_node.prev = child_list_tail

            head.next = head.child
            head.child.prev = head
            head.child = None

            return helper(next_node) if next_node else child_list_tail


        helper(head)
        return head
```
