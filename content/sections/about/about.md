My name is Peter Tao, and I am a software engineer. I got my Computer Science Degree from the University of Toronto. Depending on the day, I can either be fixing my life or fixing some bugs - But I enjoy building things the most.

I am currently working at Amazon Web Service on the world's most complex cloud storage infrastructure. Prior to that, I had several full-stack experiences on different projects.

I have too many things that I want to build (games, apps, etc) and too many things I want to automate, but I am mostly working on taking care of myself and being a happy person now.

I live in Toronto but soon will move to Vancouver. If you want to hang out/talk/play games today, you know how to find me.
