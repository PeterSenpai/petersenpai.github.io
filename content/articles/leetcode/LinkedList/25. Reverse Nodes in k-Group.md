# LC25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

```python
def reverseKGroup( head, k):
        """
        1. create a helper that reverse the list except last one and return the new head and new tail (except last one)
        2. create a dummy(point to head) and a left pointer points to dummy
        3. create a right pointer points to head
        4. while right pointer is not None, move right pointer k steps to position k + 1
        5. reverse everything in (left pointer, right pointer) i.e. reverse_list_except_last(left.next, right)
        6. get the new_head and new_tail from the function call
        7. left.next = new_head, then left = new_tail, then new_tail.next = right
        8. keep moving right pointer by k step
        9. final step, check the counter again
