# LC19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

The idea is to have 2 pointers
1/ 2 pointers should have (n - 1) node between or n steps away (aka left should move n times to reach right)
2/ we want the right pointer to point to the last node of the list

This way, the left pointer is exactly one node ahead of the node that needs to be removed.

Since they are n steps away, we can first move the right pointer n times, then we move both till right at the last node

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        left = right = head

        while n:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1

        if not right:
            return head.next

        while right.next:
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        left.next = left.next.next

        return head

```
